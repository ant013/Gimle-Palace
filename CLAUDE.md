# Gimle Palace — Developer Guide

## Branch Flow

Single mainline: `develop`. Feature branches cut from develop, PR'd back.
`main` is an optional release-stable reference.

```
feature/GIM-N-<slug>    (all work: code, spec, plan, research, docs)
      │
      ▼  PR → squash-merge (CI green + CR paperclip APPROVE + CR GitHub review + QA evidence present)
develop                   (integration tip; iMac deploys from here)
      │
      ▼  .github/workflows/release-cut.yml (label `release-cut` on a merged PR, or workflow_dispatch)
main                      (stable release ref — tags live here)
```

**Iron rules:**
- Every change — product code, spec, plan, research, postmortem, role-file, CLAUDE.md itself — goes through a feature branch + PR. Zero direct human commits to `develop` or `main`.
- Force push forbidden on `develop` / `main`; on feature branches only `--force-with-lease` AND only when you are the sole writer of the current phase (see `git-workflow.md` fragment).
- Branch protection on develop + main: admin-bypass disabled. All required checks must pass for PR merge. `main` accepts push only from `github-actions[bot]` via `release-cut.yml`.
- Feature branches live in paperclip-managed worktrees; primary repo stays on `develop`.
- **Operator/Board checkout location:** a separate clone, typically `~/<project>-board/` or `~/Android/<project>/`. Never use the production deploy checkout (`/Users/Shared/Ios/<project>/`) for spec/plan writing.

**Spec + plan location:** `docs/superpowers/specs/` and `docs/superpowers/plans/` on the feature branch. After squash-merge they land on develop. Main gets them only when `release-cut.yml` Action runs.

**Required status checks on develop:**
- `lint`
- `typecheck`
- `test`
- `docker-build`
- `qa-evidence-present` (verifies PR body has `## QA Evidence` with SHA, unless `micro-slice` label)

**CR approval path:** CR posts full compliance comment on paperclip issue AND `gh pr review --approve` on the GitHub PR (the GitHub review satisfies branch-protection's "Require PR reviews" rule).

**Release-cut procedure:** to update `main`:
1. Add label `release-cut` to a merged develop PR, OR
2. Run `gh workflow run release-cut.yml`.

The Action opens a PR `develop → main`, enables auto-merge with rebase
strategy, and (after merge) pushes an annotated tag `release-<date>-<sha>`.
Uses only the workflow's `GITHUB_TOKEN` — no PAT or App needed. No human
pushes `main`, ever.

See also:
- `paperclips/fragments/shared/fragments/git-workflow.md` — per-agent rules.
- `docs/runbooks/2026-04-19-meta-workflow-migration-rollback.md` — if branch protection or the new workflows cause a block and need to be reverted.

## Production deploy on iMac

After a PR squash-merges to `develop`, rebuild and restart `palace-mcp` with:

```bash
bash paperclips/scripts/imac-deploy.sh
```

The script must run **on the iMac** (SSH in first, then invoke locally).

- Pinned deploy: `bash paperclips/scripts/imac-deploy.sh --target <sha>`
- Assert extractor: `bash paperclips/scripts/imac-deploy.sh --expect-extractor symbol_index_typescript`
- Rollback: see `paperclips/scripts/imac-deploy.README.md` — tag `prev_image`
  from `imac-deploy.log` and `docker compose up -d --no-build palace-mcp`

Prerequisites and all five deploy gotchas are documented in
`paperclips/scripts/imac-deploy.README.md`.

## AGENTS.md deploy on iMac

After a release-cut merges to `main`, update live agent role files with:

```bash
bash paperclips/scripts/imac-agents-deploy.sh
```

The script must run **on the iMac** (SSH in first, then invoke locally).

- Pinned deploy: `bash paperclips/scripts/imac-agents-deploy.sh --target-sha <sha>`
- Rollback: see `paperclips/scripts/imac-agents-deploy.README.md`

No Docker needed — the script copies rendered AGENTS.md files from a
temporary `origin/main` worktree to live agent bundle directories.
Paperclip reads AGENTS.md fresh on each agent run, so no restart is required.

## Docker Compose Profiles

Services use explicit profile opt-in:

```bash
docker compose --profile review up -d    # palace-mcp + neo4j
docker compose --profile analyze up -d   # analyze mode
docker compose --profile full up -d      # full mode
```

No profile → no services start (intentional — forces explicit opt-in).

## Environment

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill real values before starting
compose. Required at minimum: `NEO4J_PASSWORD`.

`PALACE_DEFAULT_GROUP_ID` (default `project/gimle`) namespaces all
Issue/Comment/Agent/IngestRun nodes. Do **not** change casually — it
determines which rows ingest writes against and GC scopes on.

## Docs layout

- `docs/superpowers/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md` — design specs (Board
  output). Revisions keep the old file with a deprecation banner at
  the top; new revisions add `-rev3` suffix.
- `docs/superpowers/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-GIM-<N>-<slug>.md` — TDD
  implementation plans, one per issue. `GIM-NN` placeholder is
  swapped for the real issue number when CTO formalizes in Phase 1.1.
- `docs/postmortems/YYYY-MM-DD-<incident>.md` — one file per incident
  in the three-gate analysis format established by GIM-48.
- `docs/research/` — external library verification, competitive
  analysis, extractor inventory, etc. Treat older research docs as
  historical; verify library APIs against the installed version
  before reusing any claim.

## Paperclip team workflow

Product slices of meaningful size (>200 LOC or cross-cutting) go
through the paperclip agent team rather than being implemented
inline. Canonical phase sequence:

- **1.1 Formalize** (CTO) — verify Board's spec+plan paths, swap the
  `GIM-NN` placeholder, reassign to CodeReviewer.
- **1.2 Plan-first review** (CodeReviewer) — validate every task has
  concrete test+impl+commit; flag gaps; APPROVE → reassign to
  implementer.
- **2 Implement** (MCPEngineer / PythonEngineer / …) — TDD through
  plan tasks on `feature/GIM-<N>-<slug>`; push frequently.
- **3.1 Mechanical review** (CodeReviewer) — paste
  `uv run ruff check && uv run mypy src/ && uv run pytest` output in
  APPROVE; no "LGTM" rubber-stamps.
- **3.2 Adversarial review** (OpusArchitectReviewer) — poke holes;
  findings addressed before Phase 4.
- **4.1 Live smoke** (QAEngineer) — on iMac; real MCP tool call + CLI
  + direct Cypher invariant. Evidence comment authored by
  QAEngineer.
- **4.2 Merge** — squash-merge to develop after CI green. No admin
  override.

Phase-handoff discipline is encoded in the shared-fragment
`phase-handoff.md` (submodule `paperclip-shared-fragments`, wired
into every role's `AGENTS.md`). Reassign explicitly between phases —
`status=todo` between phases is forbidden.

## Operator auto-memory

The operator's Claude Code session maintains an auto-memory store
alongside this repo. A fresh session should look there for current
slice status, paperclip API tokens, known library pitfalls, incident
lessons, and deploy notes. The repo itself assumes operator memory
exists but does not reference any single memory file by path.

## Mounting project repos for palace.git.*

`palace-mcp` exposes 5 read-only git tools (`palace.git.log`, `.show`,
`.blame`, `.diff`, `.ls_tree`). Each tool takes a `project` slug that
must correspond to a directory bind-mounted at `/repos/<slug>` inside
the container.

**Currently mounted projects (docker-compose.yml):**

| Slug         | Host path                                                                           | Mount                    |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| `gimle`      | `/Users/Shared/Ios/Gimle-Palace`                                                    | `/repos/gimle:ro`        |
| `oz-v5-mini` | `services/palace-mcp/tests/extractors/fixtures/oz-v5-mini-project` (repo-relative) | `/repos/oz-v5-mini:ro`   |
| `uw-android` | `/Users/Shared/Android/unstoppable-wallet-android`                                  | `/repos/uw-android:ro`   |
| `uw-ios-mini`| `services/palace-mcp/tests/extractors/fixtures/uw-ios-mini-project` (repo-relative) | `/repos/uw-ios-mini:ro` |
| `uw-ios`     | `/Users/Shared/Ios/unstoppable-wallet-ios`                                          | `/repos/uw-ios:ro`       |
| HS Kits (parent) | `/Users/Shared/Ios/HorizontalSystems` (41 repos; GIM-182 `uw-ios` bundle)   | `/repos-hs:ro`           |

### Non-iMac contributors

Real-project bind-mounts (`gimle`, `uw-android`, `uw-ios`) use absolute Mac paths
(`/Users/Shared/...`) for operator-iMac convention. Non-iMac contributors
should:

- Create `docker-compose.override.yml` redirecting these paths to local clones, OR
- Run `docker compose --profile review up` excluding affected services and use only
  fixture-based mounts (paths under `./services/palace-mcp/tests/extractors/fixtures/`)
  which work cross-platform.

The HS parent mount (`/repos-hs`) serves all 41 UW-iOS bundle members via
`parent_mount="hs"` + `relative_path` parameters in `register_project`. Each Kit
resolves to `/repos-hs/<relative_path>` inside the container. Non-iMac contributors
should override the host path in `docker-compose.override.yml`.

**To add a new project:**
1. Add a bind-mount entry to `docker-compose.yml` under `palace-mcp.volumes`:
   ```yaml
   - /path/to/your/repo:/repos/your-slug:ro
   ```
2. Restart the `palace-mcp` container (`docker compose --profile review up -d --force-recreate palace-mcp`).
3. Optionally register the project in Neo4j via `palace.memory.register_project` so
   it appears in `palace.memory.health` without the `git_repos_unregistered` warning.

**Security notes:**
- All bind-mounts are read-only (`:ro`).
- `git` commands run with a sanitized environment (`GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM=1`,
  `PATH=/usr/bin:/bin`, no `HOME` git config) — the container cannot write
  to or exfiltrate credentials from mounted repos.
- Only whitelisted git verbs (`log`, `show`, `blame`, `diff`, `ls-tree`,
  `cat-file`) are executed; write verbs are blocked at the subprocess layer.

## Pinning

When editing specs or plans, always reference the commit SHA or
branch state the artefact is grounded in — do not assume "current
develop" still means what it meant when a future reader lands here.
Cite a predecessor slice's merge SHA in spec headers.

## Bundles (GIM-182)

A **bundle** is a virtual project aggregating per-member project indexes so that
`palace.code.find_references(project="<bundle>")` resolves across all members in
one call. Bundles use `group_id = "bundle/<name>"` (distinct from `"project/<slug>"`).

**uw-ios bundle:** `uw-ios-app` (UW iOS app) + 40 first-party HorizontalSystems Swift Kits.
Canonical member list: `services/palace-mcp/scripts/uw-ios-bundle-manifest.json`.

### Bundle MCP tools

- `palace.memory.register_bundle(name, description)` — create/update a Bundle node.
- `palace.memory.add_to_bundle(bundle, project, tier)` — add a member (idempotent).
- `palace.memory.bundle_members(bundle)` — list members with ProjectRef metadata.
- `palace.memory.bundle_status(bundle)` — freshness/health metrics (3-way failed_slugs split).
- `palace.memory.delete_bundle(name, cascade)` — remove bundle (not member :Project nodes).
- `palace.ingest.run_extractor(name, bundle=...)` — async kickoff; returns `run_id` < 100 ms.
- `palace.ingest.bundle_status(run_id)` — poll async ingest progress.

**Key invariants:**
- `register_parent_mount` is NOT a v1 tool; `parent_mount` is a param on `register_project`.
- Bundle ingest is async — `run_extractor(bundle=...)` returns `run_id` immediately.
- `failed_slugs` in `bundle_status` is split into 3: `query_failed_slugs` (transient),
  `ingest_failed_slugs` (last_run failed), `never_ingested_slugs` (no run yet).

Runbook: `docs/runbooks/multi-repo-spm-ingest.md`.

## Extractors

Palace-mcp ships a pluggable extractor framework under
`services/palace-mcp/src/palace_mcp/extractors/`. Each extractor writes
domain nodes/edges to Neo4j scoped by `group_id = "project/<slug>"` and is
invoked via MCP tool `palace.ingest.run_extractor(name, project)`.

### Registered extractors

- `heartbeat` — diagnostic probe. Writes one `:ExtractorHeartbeat` node per
  run. Use to verify the pipeline is alive before running heavy extractors.
- `symbol_index_python` — Python symbol indexer. Reads a pre-generated `.scip`
  file (produced by `npx @sourcegraph/scip-python` outside the container).
  Writes occurrences into Tantivy (full-text) and `:IngestRun` + checkpoints
  into Neo4j. 3-phase bootstrap: defs/decls → user uses → vendor uses.
  Query via `palace.code.find_references(qualified_name, project)`.
- `symbol_index_typescript` — TypeScript/JavaScript symbol indexer (GIM-104).
  Reads a pre-generated `.scip` file produced by `npx @sourcegraph/scip-typescript`.
  Handles `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.js`, `.jsx` in one pass via per-document language
  auto-detection. Same 3-phase bootstrap as `symbol_index_python`. Uses the
  same `PALACE_SCIP_INDEX_PATHS` env var — add the project slug with the path
  to the TypeScript SCIP file.
- `symbol_index_java` — Java/Kotlin symbol indexer (GIM-111).
  Reads a pre-generated `.scip` file produced by `npx @sourcegraph/scip-java`
  (requires Java 17+ and Gradle). Handles `.java`, `.kt`, `.kts` in one pass
  via per-document language auto-detection. Same 3-phase bootstrap as
  `symbol_index_python`. Uses `PALACE_SCIP_INDEX_PATHS` — set the project slug
  to the scip-java output path. scip-java symbol scheme: `semanticdb maven
  <package-name> <version> <descriptor>`.
- `symbol_index_solidity` — Solidity smart-contract symbol indexer (GIM-124).
  Reads a pre-generated `.scip` file produced by `python -m palace_mcp.scip_emit.solidity`
  (requires `slither-analyzer>=0.11.5` installed manually — not in pyproject.toml due to
  Rust/cbor2 transitive dep). Handles `.sol` files. Same 3-phase bootstrap as
  `symbol_index_python`. Uses `PALACE_SCIP_INDEX_PATHS` — set the project slug to the
  scip_emit/solidity output path. SCIP scheme: `scip-solidity ethereum <path> . <descriptor>`.
- `symbol_index_swift` — Swift symbol indexer (GIM-128).
  Reads a pre-generated `.scip` file emitted by
  `services/palace-mcp/scip_emit_swift` from Apple IndexStoreDB on a dev Mac.
  Handles `.swift` occurrences with the same 3-phase bootstrap as the other
  SCIP-backed extractors. Uses `PALACE_SCIP_INDEX_PATHS` — merge-gate fixture
  slug is `uw-ios-mini`; optional real-source follow-up slug is `uw-ios`.
- `dependency_surface` — Dependency Surface Extractor (GIM-191). Parses declared
  + resolved deps from SPM (`Package.swift` + `Package.resolved` v2/v3), Gradle
  (`gradle/libs.versions.toml` + per-module `build.gradle.kts`), and Python
  (`pyproject.toml` PEP 621 + `uv.lock`). Writes `:ExternalDependency` nodes +
  `:DEPENDS_ON` edges. Single-phase; no SCIP file or env vars needed.
  See `docs/runbooks/dependency-surface.md`.
- `git_history` — Git history harvester (GIM-186). Walks pygit2 commit
  history (Phase 1) + GitHub GraphQL PR/comment data (Phase 2). Foundation for
  6 historical extractors (#11/#12/#26/#32/#43/#44). Per-project incremental
  refresh; checkpoint in `:GitHistoryCheckpoint`. Requires `PALACE_GITHUB_TOKEN`
  env var for Phase 2 (PR data); Phase 1 (commits) runs without it. Full re-walk
  on force-push detected automatically. See `docs/runbooks/git-history-harvester.md`.
- `code_ownership` — Code ownership extractor (GIM-216, Roadmap #32). Reads
  `:Author` / `:Commit` / `:TOUCHED` from `git_history` (GIM-186) + does
  per-file `pygit2.blame` on HEAD. Writes `(:File)-[:OWNED_BY]->(:Author)`
  edges with `weight = α × blame_share + (1-α) × recency_churn_share`
  (α default 0.5, env `PALACE_OWNERSHIP_BLAME_WEIGHT`). Per-file
  incremental refresh via `:OwnershipCheckpoint`. Sidecar
  `:OwnershipFileState` for `find_owners` empty-state diagnostics.
  `.mailmap`-aware via pygit2 (no custom parser). Query via
  `palace.code.find_owners(file_path, project, top_n=5)`.
- `coding_convention` — Coding convention extractor (GIM-238, Roadmap #6).
  Scans Swift + Kotlin source files directly from the mounted repo and derives
  per-module dominant style choices plus outliers for 7 heuristic rule kinds:
  type naming, test naming, protocol/interface naming, ADT pattern, error
  modeling, collection initialization, and computed-vs-lazy property style.
  Writes `:Convention`, `:ConventionViolation`, and extractor-scoped
  `:IngestRun` rows. See `docs/runbooks/coding-convention.md`.
- `hotspot` — Code-Complexity × Churn Hotspot extractor (GIM-195, Roadmap #44).
  Walks repo with stop-list, calls `lizard` per-batch (50 files), aggregates
  per-function CCN to per-file `ccn_total`, joins with `git_history`'s
  `(:Commit)-[:TOUCHED]->(:File)` graph for churn count in a configurable
  window (default 90 days), writes Tornhill log-log `hotspot_score` on `:File`
  + new `:Function` nodes. Query via `palace.code.find_hotspots(project)` for
  top-N hotspots and `palace.code.list_functions(project, path)` for per-
  function complexity. Requires `git_history` to have run first (otherwise
  churn = 0).
- `reactive_dependency_tracer` — Swift-first reactive state/effect extractor
  (GIM-217, Roadmap #3). Reads pre-generated `reactive_facts.json` from repo
  root, writes `ReactiveComponent` / `ReactiveState` / `ReactiveEffect` /
  `ReactiveDiagnostic` plus exact correlation edges to `SymbolOccurrenceShadow`
  and `PublicApiSymbol` when those backing facts exist. v1 does not execute a
  live Swift helper and treats Kotlin/Compose only as structured skip evidence.
  See `docs/runbooks/reactive-dependency-tracer.md`.
- `cross_repo_version_skew` — Cross-repo version skew (GIM-218, Roadmap #39).
  Reads `:Project-[:DEPENDS_ON]->:ExternalDependency` from `dependency_surface`
  (GIM-191) — fully read-only; writes only one `:IngestRun` per call. Hybrid:
  small extractor (audit/observability via `:IngestRun` extras) + live MCP
  tool `palace.code.find_version_skew` for real-time aggregation. Project
  mode finds intra-module skew via `r.declared_in`; bundle mode aggregates
  across `:Bundle{name}-[:HAS_MEMBER]` members. See limitations in
  `docs/runbooks/cross-repo-version-skew.md`.

### Operator workflow: Dependency surface

No env vars required. Extractor reads files directly from the mounted repo.

1. Ensure repo mounted in `docker-compose.yml` at `/repos/<slug>`.
2. Run the extractor:
   ```
   palace.ingest.run_extractor(name="dependency_surface", project="gimle")
   ```
3. Query results:
   ```cypher
   MATCH (p:Project {slug: "gimle"})-[r:DEPENDS_ON]->(d:ExternalDependency)
   RETURN d.purl, r.scope, r.declared_in ORDER BY d.purl
   ```

### Operator workflow: Reactive dependency tracer

1. Ensure the target repo contains a pre-generated `reactive_facts.json` at repo
   root. v1 does not launch SwiftSyntax or any helper binary from the extractor.
2. Run the extractor:
   ```
   palace.ingest.run_extractor(name="reactive_dependency_tracer", project="<slug>")
   ```
3. Verify resulting graph slices with the Cypher snippets in
   `docs/runbooks/reactive-dependency-tracer.md`.
4. If the run emits `swift_helper_unavailable`, `swift_parse_failed`, or
   `symbol_correlation_unavailable`, use the troubleshooting section in the
   runbook instead of retrying with a live helper path.

### Operator workflow: Java/Kotlin symbol index

1. Generate `.scip` file outside the container (requires Java 17+ and Gradle):
   ```bash
   cd /repos/your-java-project
   gradle wrapper && ./gradlew compileKotlin compileJava
   npx @sourcegraph/scip-java index --output ./scip/index.scip
   ```

2. Set env var for palace-mcp container in `.env`:
   ```
   PALACE_SCIP_INDEX_PATHS={"your-project":"/repos/your-project/scip/index.scip"}
   ```

3. Run the extractor:
   ```
   palace.ingest.run_extractor(name="symbol_index_java", project="your-project")
   ```

### Operator workflow: Android symbol index (modern Compose + KSP + multi-module)

Android projects (e.g., `unstoppable-wallet-android`) use scip-java with the real
Android Gradle Plugin classpath. Requires semanticdb-kotlinc 0.5.0 (NOT 0.6.0 — breaks
on Kotlin 2.1+ with `AbstractMethodError`). AGP 9+ is not yet supported by scip-java
auto-mode; pin to AGP ≤8.13.x until upstream fixes (GIM-127; Sourcegraph issue #864).

1. Clone target project on iMac:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/horizontalsystems/unstoppable-wallet-android.git \
     /Users/Shared/Android/unstoppable-wallet-android
   cd /Users/Shared/Android/unstoppable-wallet-android
   # Pin to last pre-AGP-9 commit if on master:
   git checkout c0489d5a33f5da441f07b1f685d42b25b805ffd1
   ```

2. Generate `.scip` outside container (requires JDK 17+ + Gradle 8.x + semanticdb-kotlinc 0.5.0):
   ```bash
   cd /Users/Shared/Android/unstoppable-wallet-android
   # See fixture REGEN.md for the exact regen.sh command sequence
   bash services/palace-mcp/tests/extractors/fixtures/uw-android-mini-project/regen.sh
   ```

3. Set env var for palace-mcp container in `.env`:
   ```
   PALACE_SCIP_INDEX_PATHS={..., "uw-android":"/repos/uw-android/scip/index.scip"}
   ```

4. Run the extractor:
   ```
   palace.ingest.run_extractor(name="symbol_index_java", project="uw-android")
   ```

5. Query (after GIM-126 lands; currently use `palace.memory.lookup`):
   ```
   palace.code.find_references(qualified_name="WalletDao", project="uw-android")
   ```

### Operator workflow: iOS Swift symbol index

Swift indexing uses the custom emitter package at
`services/palace-mcp/scip_emit_swift`, which reads Apple IndexStoreDB and emits
canonical SCIP protobuf for the Python-side `symbol_index_swift` extractor.

Track A is the merge gate and uses the committed fixture:

1. Set env var for palace-mcp container in `.env`:
   ```
   PALACE_SCIP_INDEX_PATHS={..., "uw-ios-mini":"/repos/uw-ios-mini/scip/index.scip"}
   ```

2. Run the extractor on the committed fixture:
   ```
   palace.ingest.run_extractor(name="symbol_index_swift", project="uw-ios-mini")
   ```

3. Query references once the ingest succeeds:
   ```
   palace.code.find_references(qualified_name="UwMiniCore WalletStore", project="uw-ios-mini")
   ```

Track B is optional real-source follow-up on a dev Mac:

1. Clone the real project on the operator host:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/horizontalsystems/unstoppable-wallet-ios.git \
     /Users/Shared/Ios/unstoppable-wallet-ios
   ```

2. Build and emit SCIP on the dev Mac with the locked toolchain described in:
   `services/palace-mcp/tests/extractors/fixtures/uw-ios-mini-project/REGEN.md`

3. Set env var for palace-mcp container in `.env`:
   ```
   PALACE_SCIP_INDEX_PATHS={..., "uw-ios":"/repos/uw-ios/scip/index.scip"}
   ```

4. Run the extractor on the real-source index:
   ```
   palace.ingest.run_extractor(name="symbol_index_swift", project="uw-ios")
   ```

### Operator workflow: Python symbol index

1. Generate `.scip` file outside the container:
   ```bash
   cd /repos/gimle
   npx @sourcegraph/scip-python index --output ./scip/index.scip
   ```

2. Set env var for palace-mcp container in `.env`:
   ```
   PALACE_SCIP_INDEX_PATHS={"gimle":"/repos/gimle/scip/index.scip"}
   ```

3. Run the extractor:
   ```
   palace.ingest.run_extractor(name="symbol_index_python", project="gimle")
   ```

4. Query references:
   ```
   palace.code.find_references(qualified_name="register_code_tools", project="gimle")
   ```

### Operator workflow: Hotspot extractor

No external `.scip` file or container env file required. The extractor
walks the mounted repo directly and reads commit data from the Neo4j
graph populated by `git_history`.

1. Ensure the repo is mounted in `docker-compose.yml` at `/repos/<slug>`.
2. Run `git_history` first (so `:Commit -[:TOUCHED]-> :File` exists):
   ```
   palace.ingest.run_extractor(name="git_history", project="<slug>")
   ```
3. Run hotspot:
   ```
   palace.ingest.run_extractor(name="hotspot", project="<slug>")
   ```
4. Query top-N:
   ```
   palace.code.find_hotspots(project="<slug>", top_n=20)
   ```
5. For per-function detail on a specific file:
   ```
   palace.code.list_functions(project="<slug>", path="<file>", min_ccn=10)
   ```

**Configurable env vars** (in `.env`, all optional with sane defaults):

| Variable | Default | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|
| `PALACE_HOTSPOT_CHURN_WINDOW_DAYS` | `90` | Tornhill recommends 90 or 180 |
| `PALACE_HOTSPOT_LIZARD_BATCH_SIZE` | `50` | Files per lizard subprocess |
| `PALACE_HOTSPOT_LIZARD_TIMEOUT_S` | `30` | Per-batch subprocess timeout |
| `PALACE_HOTSPOT_LIZARD_TIMEOUT_BEHAVIOR` | `drop_batch` | `drop_batch` or `fail_run` |

**Trade-off — window changes break idempotency**: changing
`PALACE_HOTSPOT_CHURN_WINDOW_DAYS` between runs overwrites
`:File.churn_count`, `:File.complexity_window_days`, and
`:File.hotspot_score`. Idempotency invariant 4 (zero net writes on
re-run) holds only when window is unchanged.

### Operator workflow: Code ownership

Prereq: GIM-186 `git_history` extractor must have run for the project.

1. Run the extractor:
   ```
   palace.ingest.run_extractor(name="code_ownership", project="gimle")
   ```
2. Query owners:
   ```
   palace.code.find_owners(file_path="services/palace-mcp/...", project="gimle", top_n=5)
   ```

Optional: place `.mailmap` in the repo root to dedupe split identities
(standard git format — see `git help check-mailmap`).

Tunable knobs (`.env`):
- `PALACE_OWNERSHIP_BLAME_WEIGHT` (default 0.5) — α in scoring formula
- `PALACE_OWNERSHIP_MAX_FILES_PER_RUN` (default 50000)
- `PALACE_OWNERSHIP_WRITE_BATCH_SIZE` (default 2000)
- `PALACE_MAILMAP_MAX_BYTES` (default 1 MiB)

Limitations:
- File renames lose history pre-rename (pygit2 blame is path-bound)
- Submodules and binary files are skipped (`no_owners_reason='binary_or_skipped'`)
- Bundle support is not yet wired (run per-project for HS Kits)
- PII: any caller with `palace.code.*` permissions can enumerate
  contributor emails. See `docs/runbooks/code-ownership.md` for trust model.

### Running an extractor

From Claude Code (or any MCP client connected to palace-mcp):

```
palace.ingest.list_extractors()
palace.ingest.run_extractor(name="heartbeat", project="gimle")
```

Response shape (success):
```json
{"ok": true, "run_id": "<uuid>", "extractor": "heartbeat",
 "project": "gimle", "duration_ms": 42,
 "nodes_written": 1, "edges_written": 0, "success": true}
```

Error envelope on failure:
```json
{"ok": false, "error_code": "invalid_slug | unknown_extractor |
 project_not_registered | repo_not_mounted | extractor_config_error |
 extractor_runtime_error | unknown", "message": "<short>",
 "extractor": "...", "project": "...", "run_id": "..."}
```

### Adding a new extractor

1. Create `src/palace_mcp/extractors/<name>.py` with a class inheriting
   `BaseExtractor`. Declare `name`, `description`, `constraints`, `indexes`
   class attributes. Implement `async def extract(self, ctx) -> ExtractorStats`.
2. Import and register in `registry.py`:
   ```python
   from palace_mcp.extractors.<name> import <ClassName>
   EXTRACTORS["<name>"] = <ClassName>()
   ```
3. Unit test in `tests/extractors/unit/test_<name>.py` (mock driver).
4. Integration test in `tests/extractors/integration/test_<name>_integration.py`
   (real Neo4j via testcontainers or compose reuse).

### Extractor foundation substrate (GIM-101a)

All production extractors build on `extractors/foundation/`:

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `models.py` | Pydantic v2 schemas: `SymbolOccurrence`, `IngestCheckpoint`, `EvictionRecord`, … |
| `errors.py` | `ExtractorErrorCode` (18 codes) + `ExtractorError(Exception)` dataclass |
| `identifiers.py` | `symbol_id_for(qname)` — signed-i64 blake2b hash (overflow-safe) |
| `importance.py` | `BoundedInDegreeCounter` + `importance_score()` 5-component formula |
| `tantivy_bridge.py` | `TantivyBridge` async context manager wrapping tantivy-py |
| `schema.py` | `ensure_custom_schema()` — idempotent Neo4j schema with drift detection |
| `checkpoint.py` | `write_checkpoint`, `reconcile_checkpoint`, `create_ingest_run` |
| `eviction.py` | 3-round eviction (`run_eviction`) — never deletes def/decl |
| `circuit_breaker.py` | `check_phase_budget`, `check_resume_budget` — hard caps |
| `synthetic_harness.py` | Deterministic 70M-occurrence stress generator |

**Phase bootstrap order (per phase start):**
1. `check_resume_budget(previous_error_code)` — block budget-exceeded restarts
2. `ensure_custom_schema(driver)` — idempotent schema bootstrap
3. `check_phase_budget(nodes_written_so_far, ...)` — hard cap pre-flight
4. Process occurrences → `tantivy_bridge.add_or_replace_async()`
5. `write_checkpoint(driver, ...)` — after Tantivy commit
6. On restart: `reconcile_checkpoint(checkpoint, actual_doc_count)` — verify integrity

**Tantivy volume** (docker-compose): named volume `palace-tantivy-data` at
`/var/lib/palace/tantivy` inside container. Service runs as uid 1000 (non-root).
`entrypoint.sh` checks write access and fails fast on ownership mismatch.

**GDS plugin caveat**: eviction rounds 1-3 use standard Cypher (`DETACH DELETE`),
not GDS algorithms. GDS is optional — eviction works without it.

### Extractor env vars (GIM-101a)

All vars in `PalaceSettings` (config.py), prefix `PALACE_`:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `PALACE_MAX_OCCURRENCES_TOTAL` | 50 000 000 | Global hard cap across all projects |
| `PALACE_MAX_OCCURRENCES_PER_PROJECT` | 10 000 000 | Per-project hard cap |
| `PALACE_IMPORTANCE_THRESHOLD_USE` | 0.05 | Round-1 eviction floor for `use` nodes |
| `PALACE_MAX_OCCURRENCES_PER_SYMBOL` | 5 000 | Round-2 per-symbol cap |
| `PALACE_RECENCY_DECAY_DAYS` | 30.0 | Half-life for recency_decay() |
| `PALACE_TANTIVY_INDEX_PATH` | (required) | Host path for Tantivy index |
| `PALACE_TANTIVY_HEAP_MB` | 100 | Tantivy writer heap in MB |
| `PALACE_SCIP_INDEX_PATHS` | `{}` | JSON map `{slug: path}` for SCIP extractors |

### Operator workflow: Cross-repo version skew

Prereq: `dependency_surface` (GIM-191) has run for the target project /
every member of the target bundle.

1. Run the extractor (writes one :IngestRun per call):
   ```
   palace.ingest.run_extractor(name="cross_repo_version_skew", project="uw-android")
   # or for a bundle:
   palace.ingest.run_extractor(name="cross_repo_version_skew", bundle="uw-ios")
   ```

2. Query skew:
   ```
   palace.code.find_version_skew(bundle="uw-ios", min_severity="minor", top_n=20)
   ```

Tunable knobs (`.env`):
- `PALACE_VERSION_SKEW_TOP_N_MAX` (default 500)
- `PALACE_VERSION_SKEW_QUERY_TIMEOUT_S` (default 30)

Limitations:
- Project mode for canonical-Gradle / SPM / Python projects finds zero
  intra-module skew (aliases / single manifest = same version per scope).
  Use bundle-of-1 for forward compatibility.
- Compares resolved_version only; declared-constraint skew is followup.
- Calendar versions / git-shas / custom schemes classify as 'unknown'.
- No Renovate "latest version" data; no OWASP CVE enrichment.

### Known limitations

- **`palace.memory.health()` shows only paperclip ingest runs**, not
  extractor runs (`memory/health.py:46` hardcodes `source="paperclip"`).
  Query extractor runs via `palace.memory.lookup(entity_type="IngestRun",
  filters={"source": "extractor.<name>"})`. UI-friendly health grouping
  is a followup.
- **No scheduler** — extractor runs are manual via MCP tool. Cron trigger
  is a followup.
- **No concurrent runs** — palace-mcp's event loop serializes MCP tool
  calls. A heavy extractor blocks other tools during its run.
