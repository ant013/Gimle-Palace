## Phase handoff discipline (iron rule)

Between plan phases (§8), always **explicit reassign** to the next-phase agent. Never leave an issue "unassigned, someone will pick up".

ALWAYS hand off by PATCHing `status + assigneeAgentId + comment` in one API call, then GET-verify the assignee; @mention-only handoff is invalid.

Grounded in GIM-48 (2026-04-18): CodeReviewer set `status=todo` after Phase 3.1 APPROVE instead of `assignee=QAEngineer`; CTO saw `todo` and closed via `done` without Phase 4.1 evidence; merged code crashed on iMac. QA gate was skipped **because no one transferred ownership**.

### Handoff matrix

| Phase done | Next phase | Required handoff |
|---|---|---|
| 1.1 Formalization (CTO) | 1.2 Plan-first review | CTO does `git mv` / rename / `GIM-57` swap **on the feature branch directly** (no sub-issue), pushes, then `assignee=CodeReviewer` + @CodeReviewer. Sub-issues for Phase 1.1 mechanical work are anti-pattern per the narrowed `cto-no-code-ban.md` scope. |
| 1.2 Plan-first (CR) | 2.x Implementation | `assignee=<implementer>` + @mention |
| 2 Implementation | 3.1 Mechanical review | `assignee=CodeReviewer` + @mention + **git push done** |
| 3.1 CR APPROVE | 3.2 Codex adversarial | `assignee=CodexArchitectReviewer` + @mention |
| 3.2 Architect APPROVE | 4.1 QA live smoke | `assignee=QAEngineer` + @mention |
| 4.1 QA PASS | 4.2 Merge | `assignee=<merger>` (usually CTO) + @mention |

### NEVER

- `status=todo` between phases. `todo` = "unassigned, free to claim" — phases require **explicit assignee**.
- `release` execution lock without simultaneous `PATCH assignee=<next-phase-agent>` — issue hangs ownerless.
- Keeping `assignee=me, status=in_progress` after my phase ends. Reassign before writing the handoff comment.
- `status=done` without verifying Phase 4.1 evidence-comment exists **from the right agent** (QAEngineer, not implementer or CR).

### Handoff comment format

```
## Phase N.M complete — [brief result]

[Evidence / artifacts / commits / links]

@<NextAgent> your turn — Phase <N.M+1>: [what to do]
```

See `heartbeat-discipline.md` §@-mentions for the parser rule. Mention wakes the next agent even if assignee is set.

### Pre-handoff checklist (implementer → reviewer)

Before writing "Phase 2 complete — @CodeReviewer":

- [ ] `git push origin <feature-branch>` done — commits live on origin
- [ ] Local green: `uv run ruff check && uv run mypy src/ && uv run pytest` (or language equivalent)
- [ ] CI on feature branch running (or auto-triggered by push)
- [ ] PR open, or will open at Phase 4.2 (per plan §8)
- [ ] Handoff comment includes **concrete commit SHAs** and branch link, not just "done"

Skip any → CR gets "done" on code not on origin → dead end.

### Pre-close checklist (CTO → status=done)

- [ ] Phase 4.2 merge done (squash-commit on develop / main)
- [ ] Phase 4.1 evidence-comment **exists** and authored by **QAEngineer** (verify `authorAgentId` in activity log / UI)
- [ ] Evidence contains: commit SHA, runtime smoke (healthcheck / tool call), plan-specific invariant check (e.g. `MATCH ... RETURN DISTINCT n.group_id`)
- [ ] CI green on merge commit (or admin override documented in merge message with reason)
- [ ] Production deploy completed post-merge (merge ≠ auto-deploy on most setups — follow the project's deploy playbook)

Any item missing → **don't close**. Escalate to Board (`@Board evidence missing on Phase 4.1 before close`).

### Phase 4.1 QA-evidence comment format

Reference (GIM-52 Phase 4.1 PASS):

```
## Phase 4.1 — QA PASS ✅

### Evidence

1. Commit SHA tested: `<git rev-parse HEAD on feature branch>`
2. `docker compose --profile <x> ps` — [containers healthy]
3. `/healthz` — `{"status":"ok","neo4j":"reachable"}` (or service equivalent)
4. MCP tool: `palace.memory.<tool>()` → [output] (real MCP call, not just healthz)
5. Ingest CLI / runtime smoke — [command output]
6. Direct invariant check (plan-specific) — e.g. `MATCH (n) RETURN DISTINCT n.group_id`, expected 1 row
7. After QA — restore the production checkout to the expected branch (follow the project's checkout-discipline rule)

@<merger> Phase 4.1 green, handing to Phase 4.2 — squash-merge to develop.
```

Replacing `/healthz`-only evidence with a real tool-call is critical. `/healthz` can be green while functionality is fundamentally broken (GIM-48). Mocked-DB pytest output does NOT count — real runtime smoke required (GIM-48 lesson).

### Lock stale edge case

If `POST /release` returns 200 but `executionAgentNameKey` doesn't reset (GIM-52 Phase 4.1, reported by CodexArchitectReviewer) — **don't ignore**.

Observed workaround (GIM-52, GIM-53): `PATCH assignee=me` → `POST /release` → `PATCH assignee=<next>` clears it. Try this first.

If the workaround fails twice — escalate to Board with details (issue id, run id, attempt sequence). Either paperclip bug or endpoint rename — Board decides.

### Self-check before handoff

- "Did I write @NextAgent with trailing space?" — yes/no
- "Is current assignee the next agent or still me?" — must be next
- "Is my push visible in `git ls-remote origin <branch>`?" — must be yes for implementer handoff
- "Is the evidence in my comment mine, or did I retell someone else's work?" — for QA, only own evidence counts
