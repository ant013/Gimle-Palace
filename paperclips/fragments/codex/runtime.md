## Codex runtime

- Project rules are in `AGENTS.md`.
- Load codebase context before implementation decisions:
  - use `codebase-memory` first when the project is indexed;
  - use `serena` for symbol navigation, references, diagnostics, and targeted edits;
  - use `context7` for version-specific external documentation;
  - use Playwright only for browser-visible behavior.
- Apply Karpathy discipline:
  - state assumptions when context is ambiguous;
  - define goal, success criteria, and verification path before broad edits;
  - make the smallest coherent change that solves the task;
  - avoid speculative flexibility, unrelated refactors, and formatting churn;
  - verify the changed path before completion.
- Treat Paperclip API, issue comments, and assigned work as the source of truth.
- Do not act from stale session memory. Re-read the issue, current assignment,
  and relevant repository state at the start of work.
- Keep idle wakes cheap: if there is no assigned issue, explicit mention, or
  `PAPERCLIP_TASK_ID`, exit with a short idle note.
